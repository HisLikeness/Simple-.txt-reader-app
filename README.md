# Chatbot for "Pride and Prejudice" Analysis
This project implements a simple chatbot that provides responses based on the content of *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. The chatbot processes the text and finds the most relevant response to a user's question.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for efficient analysis.
- **Similarity Matching**: Determines responses by comparing the overlap between user queries and the preprocessed text.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web-based application.

## How It Works
1. **Text Processing**:
   - The entire text of *Pride and Prejudice* is loaded and split into sentences.
   - Each sentence is preprocessed to remove stopwords, punctuation, and to lemmatize words.

2. **Query Matching**:
   - User queries are preprocessed in the same manner.
   - Each query is compared to the preprocessed text to find the sentence with the highest word overlap.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - The chatbot returns the original sentence from the text that most closely matches the user's query.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- NLTK

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download NLTK resources:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```
4. Add the text file:
   - Place the `Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.txt` file in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
3. Enter your questions related to *Pride and Prejudice* in the input box and submit to get responses.

## Example
- **Question**: "What happened at the ball?"
- **Response**: "Your response will vary depending on relevant content in the text."

## Limitations
- The chatbot's accuracy depends on simple word overlap, which may not fully capture nuanced questions.
- Responses are limited to sentences present in the text.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate advanced natural language processing (e.g., BERT or GPT models) for contextual understanding.
- Expand to support multiple texts and dynamic loading of documents.
